    Computes the number of XY bins to be used in the creation

    Parameters
    ---------
    dst: pd.DataFrame
        File containing the events for the map computation.
    thr: int (optional)
        Threshold to use 50x50 or 100x100 maps (standard values).
    n_bins: int (optional)
        The number of events to use can be chosen a priori.

    n_bins: int
        Number of bins in each direction (X,Y) (square map).

    # (the detector parameter 'next100', 'demopp', etc is present in every
    # argument list for the cities on IC). That way, the right geometry is
    # selected when running the city. In case one prefers to have a custom
    # range, it can be specified anyways.
    #
    # I was thinking of something like this:
    # from invisible_cities.database.load_db import DetectorGeo
    # XYrange = DetectorGeo('next100').values[0][0:2]
    #
    # I just left this as a first approach

    XYrange: Tuple[float, float]
        Limits in X and Y for the map computation
