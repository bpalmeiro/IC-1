-----------------------------------------------------------------------
From Spanish esmeralda (“emerald”), as first used in the novel Notre-Dame de Paris (1831) by Victor Hugo.
This city corrects hits energy and extracts topology information.
The input is penthesilea output containing hits, kdst global information and mc info.
The city outputs :
    - CHITS corrected hits table,
        - lowTh  - contains corrected hits table that passed h.Q >= charge_threshold_low constrain
        - highTh - contains corrected hits table that passed h.Q >= charge_threshold_high constrain.
                   it also contains:
                   - Ep field that is the energy of a hit after applying drop_end_point_voxel algorithm.
                   - track_id denoting to which track from Tracking/Tracks dataframe the hit belong to
    - MC info (if run number <=0)
    - Tracking/Tracks - summary of per track information
    - Summary/events  - summary of per event information
    - DST/Events      - copy of kdst information from penthesilea
